-1 '24:5|Yet, HP won't do anything about the problem.
-1 '24:6|I returned the computer to HP and they kept it for 3 months.
-1 '24:7|When I got the computer back and realizwed it still was not correct HP told me it was out of warranty and now it was my problem.
-1 '24:8|So, you can imagine how unhappy I am with this item.
-1 '24:9|Currently if I use the laptop I can't sit it on my lap because it will burn my legs.
-1 '24:11|Well, they don't care a bunch.
-1 '24:12|But, at the same time they (the company) would not and could not do anything about my problem.
-1 '24:13|I would Â say if you want to buy one of these machines be careful.
-1 '24:14|And, if you are going to deal with HP be careful.
-1 '24:15|In my house, HP is a nasty word.

-1 '127:2|Toshiba customer services will indirectly deal with your problems by constantly tranferring you from one country to another, and I am not kidding you, I called different hours of the day and you'll get someone else from another country trying to get you to tell them your life story all over again, since they make it sound like they don't have your history list of your calls right in front of them.
-1 '127:3|It's a long and tirring process that after a while it seems like their game plan was to wear you out so you would want to give up on contacting them.
-1 '127:4|And at one point, they blame me for installing a bad memory stick when I upgrade my memory for the first time during my purchase of the laptop (I bought the memory stick they recomended).
-1 '127:5|Long story short, since I experience so many problems with my laptop every since I bought it from day one, I didn't ask for a new laptop or a refund of what I pay for a crapy laptop, but just an extension of my laptop warranty for another year, they made a big deal of out that and after so many calls and complaints about their products and services, they finally gave in.

-1 '380:5|This is likely due to poor grounding and isolation between the components, and I'm hoping that it can be fixed with a ground loop isolator, but I still expected better product quality for this price range.

-1 '32:0|I bought this eMachines Notebook PC in January of this year and I am highlyÂ dissatisfied with it.
-1 '32:1|The Internet Explorer was very slow from the very beginning.
-1 '32:2|It freezes, and it always shows that there is an error, so I have to restart it a few times every time I use it.
-1 '32:3|I tried to upgrade it to a newer version a couple of months ago and I still have the same problem.
-1 '32:4|Well, I started using Google Chrome, which is a little better, but it freezes too sometimes.
-1 '32:5|This Notebook restarts every time there is a new update, so if you don't save your files and information, everything will be lost.
-1 '32:6|Another issue I have with it is the battery.
-1 '32:7|Maybe three or four months ago it started blinking all of the sudden.
-1 '32:8|"There is a small red circle next to it with a x in the middle, and when I click on it it says: "" Consider replacing your battery"" and it does not hold full charge."

-1 '256:3|I really wish I had done this years ago.
-1 '256:4|Pairing it with an iPhone is a pure pleasure - talk about painless syncing - used to take me forever - now it's a snap.
-1 '256:6|I love it - never had a computer I was so impressed with - and I've had a lot of laptops and desktops - this one is FAR AND ABOVE THE BEST ONE I EVER HAD BEFORE.
-1 '94:0|I tell everyone that I know, friends, family and enemies this is the absolute worst computer i have ever used.

-1 '94:11|Then to make matters worst, there is noone that they can transfer you to.
-1 '96:0|I had this computer for one month and had to send it in for repair.
-1 '96:1|Got the computer back a month later and it was still broken sent it out again and they repaired it.
-1 '96:2|3 weeks went by and the computer keeps crashing and will not open any applications.

-1 '374:0|I have had this laptop for a few months now and i would say im pretty satisfied.
-1 '374:1|The only problems are the sound isnt very loud I have to wear headphones.
-1 '374:2|Another thing is that after only a month the left mouse key broke and it costed $175 to send it in to fix it.

-1 '374:3|That whole experience was just ridiculous we sent it in and after they told us that we had to pay $175 to fix it we were like we will just by a portable mouse which would be way cheaper but they refused to send the laptop back until we paid the $175 and it was fixed.

-1 '374:4|It took a little over 2 weeks until i got it back.
-1 '374:5|ANd I babyed the heck out of it just one day when i opened it turned it on went to click and it was broke.
-1 '374:7|To be honest i think it was faulty equipment or something but idk.
-1 '374:8|The graphics are great.
-1 '374:9|The internet speed is spectacular.

-1 '374:11|Oh and it has word and stuff but its a trial verion so after about a month or so when you go to open it it asks for a product key which didnt come with the computer and even after clicking cancel it wont let you use it at all I use the old word processer which works good.
-1 '374:12|I would recommend it just because of the internet speed probably because thats the only thing i really care about.

-1 '349:0|I received this laptop as a gift and let me just tell you that its the worst.
-1 '349:1|At first it worked well for a month or so then the system board failed and I send it in to toshiba some complaints and three weeks later I then receive my laptop back only to discover that it still has the same problem so now I have to send it back again to get it fixed again.

-1 '349:2|This computer doesn't do that well with certain games it can't play some and it becomes too hot while playing games.
-1 '349:3|Oh and if thats not bad enough it doesn't come with a recovery cd so you can make one if you know how to or buy one if you buy it the cost is $25 for two cds.
-1 '349:4|the whole experiece is horrible so save up and buy a better laptop.
-1 '97:0|I bought a HP Pavilion DV4-1222nr laptop and have had so many problems with the computer.
-1 '97:1|The computer is so slow, even after paying staples the extra money to speed it up.
-1 '97:2|They said it was a computer error on this type of computer.
-1 '97:3|Also, I have alot of trouble with it getting very hot, and not even sitting on anything to make it hot.
-1 '97:4|When the computer has been on for several minutes, it will occasionaly just go off by itself.
-1 '97:5|Also, the battery does not last very long at all.
-1 '97:6|I would recommend not buying this product.
-1 '97:7|I have had no luck with staples or HP to resolve this problem.
-1 '97:8|I am stuck with a laptop that I cannot do very much with.
-1 '97:9|Also, I have had alot of trouble with the keys sticking and will not type correctly.
-1 '97:10|Also, I have had alot of trouble with the shift key to go to other lines.
-1 '97:11|It gets stuck all of the time you use it, and you have to keep tapping on it to get it to work.

-1 '230:0|I hate it.
-1 '230:1|I have had the luxury (sarcasm) of owning 2 of these laptops.
-1 '230:2|The first fell apart right after the 1-year-warranty.
-1 '230:3|During that time, I had to send it back 3 times.
-1 '230:4|I paid about 18000 for this laptop because of all the bells and whistles and it kept crapping out on me.

-1 '230:5|None of the techs at HP knew what they were doing.
-1 '230:6|They would repair one thing, send it back and it would still have the same problem.
-1 '230:7|The processor went on me, the fan went and the motherboard went.

-1 '230:8|I wanted to purchase the extended warranty and they refused, because they knew it was trouble.
-1 '230:9|I had something else go wrong and they said it had to be in good working order to be able to buy the warranty.
-1 '230:10|I took it to friend who temporarily fixed it and I finally paid about 1500 for the extended warranty.
-1 '230:11|I sent it back AND THEY LOST IT.
-1 '230:12|I waited and waited and no laptop.
-1 '230:13|Finally after months of research the discovered that they mailed it to a Walmart and there probably would be no way to find the box.
-1 '230:14|"I waited another month for approval and for them to ""BUILD"" me a new laptop."
-1 '230:16|I thought all my problems would finally be solved being that my old computer wouldn't go onto our wireless network and I wouldn't have the same problems because it was updated.
-1 '230:17|Here we are another year later and the computer is doing the same thing.
-1 '230:18|HP didn't fix it.
-1 '230:19|I swear they design these things to go to crap after a year so you are stuck and have to buy a new one.
-1 '130:1|in 5 months the connect quality got worse and worse.
-1 '130:1|in 5 months the connect quality got worse and worse.
-1 '130:2|1st time they got it working the next 5 month they had me send it in.
-1 '130:3|returned it.
-1 '130:4|5 months dead again.
-1 '130:5|They say sorry out of warranty.
-1 '130:6|Summary: They played games with me for the warranty period.
-1 '130:7|Now 17 months later they want (would not say exact amount) $165.00 to $400 to fix the machine.
-1 '130:8|They had me send in the machine last April returned it to me in May with no documentation on what was done it anything.
-1 '130:9|Now the machine won't connect and Toshiba says that they did replace the connection card in May but they only warranty the repair for 30 days and now I'm out of warranty even though this has been a constant 5 month occurance since I bought the netbook.

-1 '52:3|I burned my leg, after lifting it from my desk, and for less than 5 second putting it on my lap to clean my coffee table, so I can place it there.
-1 '52:4|I had to call Apple 19 times (each time 40 to 75 minutes on the phone), and take it to their store for evaluations, and diagnostics, 5 times.
-1 '52:9|For my burn thigh which has put a permanent mark on my skin (it happened 7 months ago) they offered me an ITouch 8Gig (you know it is a bit insulating when a company this rich, offer a loyal customer like me, a bottom of their product line as a gift for events like this).
-1 '52:10|Steve Jobs, probably needs help and donations, and cannot afford a reasonable offers for people that truly are trying to support his baby.
-1 '52:11|The lesson learned here is: It does not pay to by this loyal to any brand, since all of them are there to simply  to make as much money as possible, as fast as they can, and in this day and age, the customer no longer is right all the times.
-1 '235:1|I am not going to sit here and complain about it not having a cd drive and what not because it is a netbook, it is made to be compact and if you want all the other stuff get a laptop.
-1 '235:2|Anyways I bought this two months ago and when I first brought it home it kept giving me a message about a vibration in the hard drive and it is putting it temporaly in save zone.
-1 '235:3|So I called customer support (which is good too) and they went through it and it is just a safety feature and it does not affect performance at all, I just chose to hide the message.
-1 '235:5|Also the speakers are not very loud, But it is a netbook.
-1 '235:6|Would HIGHLY recommend this netbook though.
-1 '49:1|I custom ordered the machine from HP and could NOT understand the techie due to his accent.
-1 '49:4|The computer was two weeks late in delivery because HP forgot to complete the required import paperwork.

-1 '92:7|This was the 3rd day and part still had not been shipped.
-1 '92:10|The rep did not even answer my question, I had to ask him, if he understood what I ask or if he spoke english because he didn't even try to acknowledge my question.

1 '42:9|also the keyboard does not liht up so unless your sitting in a room with some light you cant see anything and thats bad for me because my boyfriend tends to watch tv in the dark at night which leaves me with no way of seeing the keyboard.

-1 '42:10|So i would not reccomend anyone buying this computer
-1 '6:0|First, it does not have a push button to open the lid.
-1 '6:1|It is held in place magnetically.
-1 '6:2|There is a little indent to help open it - but good luck with that.

-1 '6:5|Using this machine is like a mild form of torture.

-1 '6:9|Also, the space bar makes a noisy click every time you use it.
-1 '6:10|I hate to say this, but if I could take this back to the shop and get my money back, then I would.
-1 '6:11|It is absolutely horrible to use, despite all its so called advanced features.

-1 '6:14|It's a bummer and one out of five is being kind.
-1 '6:15|My Mac has gone from being a trusted friend to an adversary.
-1 '6:17|In due course, I'll remove the hard disc from this new MacBook Pro and dump it where it belongs - in the trash.
-1 '68:1|But the screen size is not that bad for email and web browsing.
-1 '68:2|I like this machine because its very lightweight...
-1 '68:3|very convenient when you travel and the battery life is excellent...

-1 '68:4|10 hours of battery life is really something else....
-1 '68:5|I highly recommend that you buy this product.
-1 '7:1|It crashes, and when it goes flat, it just DIES (like a PC, maybe worse) and I loose all my open documents!
-1 '7:2|I Hate it!
-1 '70:0|It is the easiest computer I have ever used
-1 '70:3|I LOVE IT!
-1 '70:4|I can't say enough good for it!
-1 '72:0|It's A MAC!!
-1 '72:1|"I fine Apple MC373LL/A 2.66GHz 15"" Macboook Pro Notebook meets all my needs for a laptop computer when on the go."
-1 '72:2|I like to use it at the race track to handiecap the horse races.
-1 '72:3|It's face and depanable.
-1 '72:4|As a graphic arts a retired instructor I still love to play with the graphic with photos and clip art .....
-1 '72:5|it's just a great toy to have around.
-1 '73:0|very very slow laptop.
-1 '73:1|tons of bloatware and junk programs.

-1 '266:2|It is truly a Desktop Replacement.
-1 '266:3|Very fast and efficient!
-1 '266:4|Does a great job with video shot on a Canon 5D MKII.
-1 '266:5|Very happy with my 7th Toshiba laptop!
-1 '259:0|The touchpad is very intuitive, so much so that I never want to use buttons to click again!
-1 '259:2|Of course, I also have several great software packages that came for free including iWork, GarageBand, and iMovie.

-1 '259:3|I especially appreciate the fact that it has almost zero viruses and spyware problems!
-1 '259:4|The only drawback for me is how dirty the screen gets, and rather quickly too.
-1 '259:6|I also enjoy the fact that my MacBook Pro laptop allows me to run Windows 7 on it by using the VMWare program.
-1 '259:7|Now I have the best of both worlds with all of the power and ease of the Mac!

-1 '100:0|I never have had a good result with this computer.
-1 '100:1|I was told by many  that it was a great computer, but we got one of these, and it worked  great for one year, and as soon as the warrenty was up, then it got  really bad.
-1 '100:2|They told me it was my loss even though it was the computer, not  what I've done.
-1 '100:3|The hard drive crashed as well, and I had to buy a new  power cord.

-1 '100:4|They told me to reprogram the computer, and I didn't need  to do that, and I lost pictures of my oldests first 2 years of her  life.
-1 '100:5|I don't like this company nor the toshiba brand, and I'll never  buy another one because I've put more into it then it is worth.

-1 '147:4|I returned the 2nd laptop for a full refund.
-1 '149:0|the mouse pad and buttons are the worst i've ever seen.
-1 '149:1|sometimes you will be moving your finger and the pointer will not even move.

-1 '104:4|2 months later, the battery went.
-1 '104:5|They gave me a hard time yet again, but their was a malfunction in the battery itself, it didn't die.

-1 '104:7|I had to pay $100 for a universal charger for this cheap $300 laptop.
-1 '104:8|Not worth it one bit.

-1 '104:11|Apparently under the screen there are 2 little screws and when the screen gets moved back and forth, they come loose.
-1 '104:12|And it is impossible to get them back in.
-1 '122:0|Strengths:Well-shaped
-1 '122:1|Weaknesses:A bad videocard!
-1 '122:6|After 20-30 min the screen of the notebook switched off.

-1 '122:8|I was said it's videocard.
-1 '122:9|Very disappointed!
-1 '122:10|Didn't expect to repair it at once!
-1 '122:12|Don't buy this model.
-1 '124:0|An absolutely hateful machine that no one should get of their own free will.
-1 '124:2|Mine came at $1,700 w/o a DVD burner (!).

-1 '105:3|A coupla months later, they change my hard drive.
-1 '105:4|A month or so ago, the freaking motherboard just died.
-1 '105:5|Went silently.
-1 '105:6|One night I turned the freaking thing off after using it, the next day I turn it on, no GUI, screen all dark, power light steady, hard drive light steady and not flashing as it usually does.

-1 '128:5|Then the hard drive failed;
-1 '128:6|my information was all lost (my fault, I know, but I never thought I would need to back up my information on a brand new Mac, the paragon of all computers!
-1 '128:7|So, after Apple replaced the hard drive I enjoyed another 4 months of my new computer, until it froze this morning--completely.
-1 '128:8|I can't even turn it off.
-1 '128:9|It's catatonic.
-1 '128:10|"Even if Apple replaces whatever needs replacing I wonder if, since I seem to be doubling the amount of time I get out of it each time it's ""like new,"" I might have 8 months next time."
-1 '128:12|I would rate this computer at 5 stars, but considering it has a short life span I can only give it 1 and implore anyone looking at laptops to stay away from this machine.
